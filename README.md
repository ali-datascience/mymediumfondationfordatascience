This is a Hanson tutorial that I have written on Medium. In this notebook, you will find the following practical exercises:

**Introduction to Data Science:** A framework that guides Data Science projects.<br>
**Big Data:** Understanding large-scale data and how to process it.<br>
**Python for Data Science:** Why Python is the go-to language in this field.<br>
**Fundamentals of Statistics:** The statistical foundations that power data analysis.<br>
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The art of understanding data before building models.<br>
**Data Preprocessing:** Preparing and cleaning data for analysis.<br>
**Machine Learning:** Algorithms that make machines intelligent.<br>
**Deep Learning:** Advanced technology driving artificial intelligence.<br>
**Natural Language Processing (NLP) & LLMs:** Processing human language using cutting-edge tools like Large Language Models (LLMs).<br>
